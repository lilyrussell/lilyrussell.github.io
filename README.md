## 🛠️ Featured Project: Student Consultation Outreach, Scheduling, and Follow-Up Process Automation
  
**Tools Used:** Power Automate, Excel Script, SharePoint, Teams, Outlook, Student Scheduling Platform

### 📌 Overview
Designed and implemented a fully automated system to support student consultations. Automated intake, email outreach, scheduling, documentation, and follow-up—enabling the team to expand from 1 to 4 consultants and reducing documentation time by 80%.

### ✅ Key Flows
- When receive report, then Invite Flow formats  data, using Excel Scripts, and sends Adaptive Card in Teams for human-in-the-loop approval before initiating student outreach.
- When a student schedules a consultation, then a personalized Consult Prep Sheet is  generated and populated, using Excel Scripts.
- When the Post-Consult Form is completed, then a meeting note is created and a customized Student Resource Sheet is generated. Link shared with consultant.
- After a completed consultation, then follow-up surveys are scheduled to automatically send at one week and one month later.
- When exceptions or errors occur, then backup and on-demand flows can be used to manually trigger core processes, ensuring continuity.
